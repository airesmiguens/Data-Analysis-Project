One place where you may find such information is X (formerly known as Twitter). However, X users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2024. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",

      "Broadly speaking, the job of a data scientist is to use data to understand things, create value, and inform business decisions. It it *not necessarily* to implement and utilize advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques. That's not to say that you can't or won't use ML/AI to inform business decisions, what I'm saying is that it's not always required to. Obviously this is going to depend on your company, their products, and role, but let's talk about a quintessential DS position at a quintessential company.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the problem a lot of newer or prospective Data Scientists run into is that they learn all these advanced techniques and want to start using them right away. They apply them anywhere they can, kind of shoehorning them in and not having a clear idea of what it is they are even trying to accomplish in the first place. In other words, the tools lead the problem. Of course, the way it should be is that the problem leads the tools. I'm coming to find for like 50+% of the things I'm asked to do, a time series visualization, contingency tables, and histograms are sufficient to answer the question to the satisfaction of the business leaders. That's it. We're done, on to the next one. Start simple, if the simple techniques don't answer the question, then move on to the more advanced stuff. I speak from experience, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, understanding when to use simple tools vs when to break out the big guns is way harder then figuring out how to use the big guns. Even harder still is taking your findings and translating them into actual, actionable insights that a business can use. Okay, so you built a multi-layer CNN that models customer behavior? That's great, but what does the business do with it? For example, can you use it to identify customers who might buy more product with more advertising? Can you put a list of those customers on the CEO's desk? Could a simple regression model have done the same in 1/4 of the time? These are skills that take years to learn and so it's totally understandable for newer or prospective DSs to not have them. But they do not seem to be emphasized in a lot of degree programs or MOOCs. It seems to me like they just hand you a dataset and tell you what to do with it. It's great that you can use the tools they tell you to on it, but you're missing out on the identifying which tools to even use part in the first place.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the difference between a data scientist today and a statistical analyst of yesterday? Not much, maybe data scientists use python now and Jupyter notebooks instead of R and markdown files. But the original vision for the data scientist as described by Harvard’s infamous article describing data science as the sexiest job was not just a rebranding of a statistical analyst. \n",
      "\n",
      "Data science made its debut in product. The product was always the algorithm that helped automate decision making. Recommender systems, translation, most recently chat bots. These are the things that originally got us excited about data science when we were laymen. Even in the infamous article “Data Scientist: the Sexiest Job if the 21st Century,” they primarily use the Linkedin recommender system as the tool that revolutionized the business. A product - not a report, not a stakeholder meeting, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "When the decision scientist title existed, data science was still about predictive analytics. Decision scientists have effectively been swallowed by the data science brand as expectations of what data scientists should do shifted. This impacted the field turning data science into a primarily product geared position, to more of a consultant. This is what caused the huge expectation for data scientists to revolutionize business by looking at the data and uncovering hidden trends that would give business x a huge competitive advantage and blow the rest of the competition in the dust. That’s why companies use to be willing to pay so much money for a data scientist. We all know, for the vast majority of companies… it didn’t work out that way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before the ML Engineer title existed, data scientists were the ML guys. ML use to be the very core of data science and what differentiated them from traditional analysts. It was forward looking more than backward looking. Facebooks data science ‘core’ team use to require research degrees in CS and/or Statistics to be in this core team. Other companies were less restrictive, but their core data scientists also researched and applied machine learning methodologies. It wasn’t until Lyft entered the business that core data scientists began rebranding themselves as machine learning engineers and data science became more focused on analysis than product.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2018 Lyft singlehandedly changed the data science landscape. One if Lyfts core problems when hiring analytical staff was that due to the insane hype around data science, everyone was calling themselves a data scientist whether or not they had the skills to understand and apply machine learning. Lyft noticed that when they rebranded their unpopular BI roles as data scientists, these class of people that knew nothing about predictive analysis but called themselves data scientists would apply for these roles at mass. (They got paid more too given the new title) And those were exactly the type of people that Lyft needed. You know excel and can make some visualizations on tableau? Great welcome to the data science team. Now the data science umbrella composed mainly of BI analysts, data analysts, core data scientists, and everything in between. I believe at this time the Chief Data Scientist of some tech company infamously changed his instagram handle to read ‘Machine Learning Engineer’ to differentiate himself from the new trend of what data science was becoming. \n",
      "\n",
      "How did this happen? Well, we’ve all been there or heard this story. You get onboarded as a data scientist at a company, the CEO has created a whole data science team, everyone can make a dashboard, everyone knows excel. There is no data engineering team, no product, no path forward. That is why the CEO hired so many data scientists anyway, to uncover his businesses future. Next month, and hundreds of thousands of dollars later the entire team is gutted, the CEO is fired, and the company is restarting their data practice from the bottom up starting with data engineers and software engineers. Can’t code? You’re not in. Can’t build products you’re not in. You’re on the data science team? Great, how are those KPIs looking this month? Expectations of what data science was supposed to be were way too high. Data Scientists were expected to be business magicians and lead companies next to business leaders. Some did, most didn’t. Now people have a more realistic perspective for the data science role as a non revolutionary analyst type role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who’s to blame and what’s the lesson? \n",
      "No one’s to blame, this is the hype cycle that has existed with every new thing in business. There’s a whole ‘Gen AI’ hype right now where everyone thinks AI is a chatbot. Maybe this is a cautionary tale to business leaders and aspiring data professionals to dig deeper beyond the hype so you’re not left disillusioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "TL:DR;\n",
      "Data science teams were mainly product focused machine learning teams until Lyft changed the landscape and rebranded their BI Analysts as Data Scientists. This rebranding was good for Lyft, but left many smaller companies disillusioned with Data Scientists as they began hiring BI Analyst types with the expectations that data science will revolutionize their company to become industry leaders. Those who pioneered advancements in machine learning under the data scientist title have rebranded themselves as machine learning engineers to differentiate themselves. Now the data science role is a non extraordinary analyst type role. Be careful around hype cycles so you too are not left disillusioned.\n",

      "Then, I started reading about data science, how statistics is important and how much I liked it in college, here goes the second book, [Naked Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Statistics-Stripping-Dread-Data-ebook/dp/B007Q6XLF2).\n",

I was doing all of that in an automated fashion with power query, creating automated pipelines was my passion in Excel. All I had to do was give it an updated file from our database, refresh the pipeline, take the new file, dump it into our system.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do visit 20 retailers, but the problem reached the tech team, the data was too much to handle, requiring us to give a smaller set of retailers for the agents, specifically 40 retailers.\n",

      "\n",
      "I started taking notes from his improvements to my code and asked him, what did you do?\n",
      "\n",
      "He told my my code was fine, but you used a lot of custom functions on operations that can be vectorized, I asked for a book recommendation about vectorized operations in pandas here, the guys recommended this [Data Wrangling in python book](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Wrangling-Python-Tools-Easier/dp/1491948817).\n",
      "\n",
      "After that book, I was obsessed with data automation in python using pandas and numpy only.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got also obsessed with vectorizing any operation in our code base, read something pandas specific now: [Effective Pandas](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM).\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, it was the part where he interacted with our system API.\n",

      "Since all our company data scientists and swes have access to snowflake and live databases, we, analysts, had access to only metabase.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw this as an opportunity to get known!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wrote two functions used by our entire company, ret_metabase and interact_with_google_sheets\n",
      "The first one connects to the API endpoint and then takes your credintials and the makes a session ID and gets your card ID string response in json and I convert it to a dataframe. The second requires an Api key, thenenables tge user to do anything with a google sheet, remove data set with a dataframe get data asa dataframe append on data filter views really anything in one function.\n",
      "How did I learn to do all of that? A course on youtube , just type API development in python amd a book about data structures, [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Pandas-Patterns-Manipulation-Treading/dp/B09MYXXSFM). This helped big time in optimizing my code performance and writing cleaner code.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got known and these functions are in the companies library now and people use it all the time. And I even left funny comments in the documentation and Everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kmeans thing got me really interested in machine learning and here's the first book you guys recommended: [ISLR](https://www.statlearning.com/).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really hard for me at first because I had not been introduced properly to those three topics:\n",
      "1- linear algebra\n",
      "2- calculus\n",
      "3- probability and statistics\n",
      "I took [Jon Krohn's live lessions](https://github.com/jonkrohn/ML-foundations) it's free on YouTube.\n",
      "\n",
      "But those three were later taken (started linear algebra in November 23).\n",
      "\n",
      "So I struggled back then and here, another book was suggested: Hands-on ML.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finished it and was really fucking hyped to apply the stuff I learned directly into my job, even without my manager permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that was not enough, I did not know what I should do to impact our compqny, what is data science?\n",
      "\n",
      "I read this book: [Data science with business, what you need to know about DS](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Business-Data-Analytic-Thinking/dp/1449361323)\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing I dod after understanding what kmeans is, improved our routes clustering function by standerdizing the scales of the long, lat, giving it another column ( retailer rank) that rankstarts at the maximum value the longitude and decays linearly from 31 to 30 (longitude here is from 30 to 31), I used linspace and select in numpy here to give retailers ranks. This rank was business objective (give 31 toretailers with high conversion and then 30.9 to retailers with monotonically decreasing nmv to make them order back and so on...) Any other retailer takes a zero in his face. This helped in giving optimized distance to retailers we really need to visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gave us a big boost in agents strike rate and overall performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, I applied xgboost, predicting who will place an order today if visited. Gave them the biggest rank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing this was a must, so I learned about A/B testing, and some other great bootstrapping ideas here [Practical Statistics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) Book.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pushed our strike rate from 40 to 73%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I really now see that I lack probability knowledge and maths knowledge to be a data scientist, so I read [Essential maths for DS](https://www.amazon.eg/-/en/Essential-Math-Data-Science-Fundamental/dp/1098102932).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my job was about sales operations, it was a necessary thing to automate discovering new sales areas and opportunity, previously, we used to draw polygons in areas we want to open, and then the agents are set there to wander and find retailers on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got an idea, how about I get all streets know in this area and make blocks in the intersections and then convert the coords to google maps link and give 50 daily sequential links to agents to discover areas in a more naturally sequential way? I used omnix API to get streets data and geopandas to make all other operations, I learned how to work with geopandas from their docs, really straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "This project was big, applied everything I know about pandas and data structures and business knowledge to do it, and it's up and running now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got praised for it and the head of data was impressed with the result and decided to give me access to snowflake directly to limit requests on metabase as the data was big and then I scaled the project to all regions we operate in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it was time to speak with the senior ds lead.\n",

      "Yes, LLMs are amazing, yes LLMs are hot right now, and YES they do show up in job descriptions. But in 2024 many jobs aren't actually needing in-depth experience with LLMs. They add LLM to the job description to seem sexy, because every exec is asking their team \"what's our AI strategy\" and every competitor claims to infuse AI into their products. Also, adding genAI/LLM keywords into a job description is a great way to get people to apply to the job, especially at more boring/traditional/older companies that want to seem hip and cutting edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when it comes to the interviews, I've seen that **IF** they ask about LLMs, they'll ask more project-based questions and start casually like \"oh you fine-tuned an LLM for fun or in your last work project, that's awesome, how was it?\"\n",

      "* let's do some Python Data Structures questions or Pandas data cleaning or some SQL window functions depending on the role\n",

Beyond the obvious “do they fit the medical profile which would benefit from this device”, the fact of the matter is that healthcare revolves largely around an aging population that has an inherent distrust of technology. We can give patients non-emergency medical devices, and we have no oversight over whether the patient actually interacts with their device and learns to use it, much less if they feel safe with it. The onus will increasingly be on data scientists and physicians to help their patients learn about the tech-enabled devices and feel comfortable using them. As much as we ask questions about “do we think a patient will benefit from this device?”, we also need to focus on whether we think they’ll actually be open to the idea of using a medical device recommended or powered by AI/ML technology.\n",

      "\n",
      "Data analysts are great for every day cost savings, product testing and improvements, customer optimisation etc. Most marketing and finance companies will get good value from a data analyst on site who is working across product, customer, and financial data. It’s often an easy hire too because the results are quick and tangible to upper management. If your personal strengths lie in business acumen, data mining, and statistics this can be a lucrative and enjoyable career path. \n",
      "\n",
      "Data scientists can be a little more difficult to evaluate from a profitability standpoint because their value and output has to be considered over a much longer timespan, usually. Their work is also often less tangible for hiring managers and C-Suite to comprehend, which can be an issue for data scientists when they join an environment with like this. It can become an uphill battle for the DS to prove their worth compared to their analytics counterparts who are delivering reports and spreadsheets daily. In my experience this is very rarely due to a lack of skill with the DS and rather a lack of understanding with management or a lack of clarity in terms of the project. I’ve seen things turn sour for DS’s in this situation who eventually move on to greener pastures. Generally if you’re stronger in computer science than you are in business acumen, I’d say a DS role is better suited to you than a DA role. But I think data scientists have to be far more selective about where they choose to work due to the reasons above. However DS’s can often command a higher wage. \n",

This can be a very attractive feature when you consider that a large chunk of the DS’s salary can be claimed back as a cash refund from HMRC, as well as anything the DS touches (software, hardware, cloud server costs, other members of the product team etc).\n",

The languages/frameworks that I've worked with the most are Python - Django/FatsAPI, Ruby - Ruby on Rails, TypeScript - React (even if my perspective for this field is that I shouldn't be fixed on just some languages/standards, as the industry is evolving at such a rate, that from a month to the other we might find a new tool that's 100 times more efficient).\n",

If you'd like more info about the reasons, I can edit this post and add them, but I don't want to make this too long.\n",

      "1. which one of the two is better for my future? I've been reading different posts lately about some data scientists / ml engineers saying that this field is really volatile and a lot of companies switch strategies from one day to another and many find themselves unemployed out of the blue, besides the fact that some people say that there are already too many data scientists / ml engineers for the few jobs required. But thinking about all of the advances in AI that have been happening lately, I was under the impression that this field is going to thrive in the future.\n",
      "2. I have always believed that salaries in both fields are good, but as a data scientist / ml engineer you can reach a higher max salary compared to what the max salary of a software engineer can be (even if I've also read posts that stated the contrary).\n",

      "But my problem right now is that I've ve been able to get to a point where I'm competent enough as a software engineer to make enough money to support myself, so finding another job in the same field would be easier. Since my parents are not helping me financially anymore, I don't think I would be able to get by with the paycheck of an intern (around 800 Euros/month where I live), if I were to switch fields.\n",
      "And I don't think anyone would take me in this field for anything more than an internship, because I'm aware of the fact that I do not have enough experience in Machine Learning and Statistics for any other role.\n",

      "I'm an R&D engineer working for an international company in the chemical/engineering business. I am the only one in my team with some data analytics skills. I typically spend about 20% of my time coding and analysing data for my projects (sometimes I get asked to support other colleagues too). Nothing fancy, some statistical analysis, a lot of data viz and sometimes simple modelling mostly for inferential purposes.\n",
      "Over the years my company built a relatively large and very centralized data science team, they do the heavy lifting and create production quality code.  \n",
      "In the early days I enjoyed dealing with them, they were happy that I could read the code and understand the lingo so we could cooperate very smoothly on the same project. Typically we went through their code together on a weekly basis. By the end of the project  I was aware of most of the technical decision made along the way and I could explain it pretty comfortably to the stakeholders. So much so that I started thing about a career switch. Now that team is gone and the newcomers are more senior and operate very differently. They typically provide their report on powerpoint and quite high level too, I had a few instances when I reached out and got dismissed. One particular time after they analysed some data for an RD&E project I asked the code specifying that I was really eager to learn and I got denied. Their justification was that they were afraid their code would be used the wrong way.  \n",
      "They don't seem to be interested in cooperating the same way, they rather get the data, ask all the questions, and share their final findings. They do not interact much along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This situation has been going on for over a year already, I thought I could find a sweet spot bridging between RD&E and data science, but I'm now having second thoughts and thinking I'm better off in my bubble. I'm very hesitant involving them in any project unless strictly necessary.   \n",
      "I'm interested to hear some opinion from data scientists as I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. Am I being too intrusive? Have you ever had similar experiences from the opposite side? Also do you have any career advice? Is there any value for someone with a foot in both shoes?\n",

      "\n",
      " COMMENT 2 \n",
      " There is absolutely value in having a foot in both shoes, as you put it. I think the most productive data science work is done when there is an understanding of how the analysis support decisions, and that means understanding how analysis converts into practice in the hands of the non-data scientist.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you describe sounds like fairly standard institutional rot. It happens easily that departments within companies develop self-interests. A lot of standard management theory is how to deal with this and still make everyone pull in the same direction. So in some ways, what you describe is neither data science specific, nor is it something that is entirely in your power to adjust, since it is a question of group dynamics. I've seen this happen as startups grow from being small and scrappy to larger and internally fragmented.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, some things can be done on the margins. You describe the risk that data science teams become isolated and not involved. That is a \"stick\" that can induce change. A team that few see the value of is the first to go when downsizing happens. Is there someone in the data science team who can take that bigger perspective and understand that part of their self-interest is to be useful to others? You need someone on the other side to bridge build with. One person can be enough, you do not have to get the entire team to like you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to change the old ways of doing things through specialized projects could be a way to induce change. Say you identify a potential project, not too large in scope, that could involve the data science team, but in different ways than usual. The point is that you constrain the efforts such that the deliverable simply is not a PowerPoint presentation, but code that runs somewhere doing something. I am hand-waving since this requires creativity and domain-specific understanding. But as I argued above, I think what you describe is very typical stuff that happens when ways of doing things become settled. So change the way things are done, unsettled the old ways a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe also they have some good reasons to be dismissive of you. Perhaps some analysis has become sufficiently routine that it can be automated far more and all the decision-makers need is the bottom line finding. This is also part of becoming more professional, to speed up some stuff that have adequate solutions such that one can focus on value creation and problem-solving elsewhere in the company. This is not to say that you should stop being interested or inquisitive, only that there can be good reasons for you to move on and find more productive areas to get involved in. This is part of the give and take of teamwork and in a well-run company, there is acceptance that sometimes people challenge others in what they do and argue for change. Friction is part of business, especially if you look to go outside your comfort zone and the organizational boundaries.\n",

      "I was offered a high-level DS manager position at one of the MAANG companies. During the hiring process, I discussed with the hiring manager that I would start as an individual contributor, focusing on helping to improve the recommendation engine. Several months later, I was supposed to transition into managing a small team. I was extremely excited, it’s MAANG, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, on my very first day of the job, my manager’s peer informed me that there had been a reorg. As a result, the tasks we had initially discussed would not be happening. To make matters worse, it turned out that my manager’s planned promotion didn’t materialize, leaving no team for me to manage. I thought, “Okay, I can live with this. Worst-case scenario, I’ll transfer to another team later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward two weeks, and I honestly hate it. The tools we use are awful. Simple tasks that would take minutes outside of big tech now take up to an hour because our small databases constantly crash under load. Even building a basic causal model becomes incredibly challenging because we can’t extract data from the database for a sufficiently long period. When I raised these concerns with my manager, their response was, “I’m not a fan of complex modeling. If you want to do that, let’s outsource it to the Data Engineering (DE) team.”\n",

      "What’s more, my daily work involves adding charts to dashboards and handling ad hoc requests from various stakeholders.

The most disconcerting part is that every other Data Scientist in our part of the organization seems to be doing the same — ad-hocs, reports, and dashboards. Frankly, this doesn’t feel like DS work at all.\n",

      "In my previous workplace, I held the responsibility of creating models and introducing new ways to leverage data to increase our KPIs.

When I decided to leave, my employer has repeated several times that should anything go wrong, I shouldn’t hesitate and come back to working for them. I’m seriously consider this option now.

I wanted to break into data science, and so it being lock down and nothing else for me to do, I started teaching myself the cutting edge of the field at the time, things like neural nets and a bunch of advanced ML techniques. I did several projects on my own (no, not just titanic and mnist datasets) and created an online public portfolio. I applied to tons of data science jobs but had no luck. I've been able to increase my salary through a progression of analyst jobs, but none of them really use anything advanced.
